# The Art of Unit Testing - C# Samples

This repository contains practical code examples from the book **"The Art of Unit Testing" by Roy Osherove**, implemented in **C#**.

The goal of this project is to:
- Reinforce the concepts covered in the book through hands-on practice.
- Provide clear, organized, and testable C# examples for developers learning or revisiting unit testing fundamentals.
- Serve as a reference or base for writing better, cleaner tests in real-world applications.
